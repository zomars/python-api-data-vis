# Python project - Data Visualization using APIs

With this project, Iâ€™ll learn how to write a self-contained program that generates a visualization based on data that it retrieves.

This project will use a web application programming interface (API) to automatically request specific information from a website and then use that information to generate an always up to date visualization.
